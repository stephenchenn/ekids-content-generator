run ./run.sh to generate ekids content for a specific year under folder 'church-ekids-program'

to renew access token, go to https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/info/df49zavmtwkklcu#settings and click 'Generate access token'

it goes through the following steps:
1. create.py <year> creates the dropbox folders
2. init-json <year> generates the skeleton json to hold the links to the folders
3. shared-links-gen.py <year> <token> creates the links and populate them in the skeleton json
4. html-gen.py <year> uses the link json to create the html to be pasted into squarespace code element

ensure the dropbox is cleared for that year before running it
